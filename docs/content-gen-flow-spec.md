# Content Generation Flow — Design Spec

**Status:** Draft (awaiting review)
**Owner:** Val
**Date:** 2026-06-28
**Surface:** `src/lib/flow/flow-templates.ts` — adds a new template to the existing Flow subsystem
**Refs:** Builds on patterns from `deep-research` (research pipeline), `pr-review` (per-branch fan-out), `flow-required-inputs` design (#1983/#1994/#1997/#1998)

---

## Goal

Add a Flow template that automates **long-form content generation across three surfaces (blog, Twitter thread, Discord)** from a single research run. The template is added to `FLOW_TEMPLATES` so it appears in the existing Flow Template Gallery; no new infrastructure is required.

## Non-goals

- **Direct publishing.** Drafts land in `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` for hand-polish. No auto-posting to Twitter/Discord/blog. (Auto-publish is a separate flow that can wrap this one later.)
- **Topic scheduling / recurring runs.** Single-trigger, user-provided topic per run. Recurring topics can be layered later via the existing Cron + Flow integration.
- **A new familiar.** Uses the existing Sage / Charm / Kitty roles. No new role definitions.
- **Tone / style heuristics in the template.** Style comes from a referenced `style-guide.md` file loaded once per run, not from hardcoded prompts in the template node config.

## User story

> Val opens the Flow surface, clicks "From template", picks "Content Generation". The flow prompts for a topic. Sage plans + searches + synthesizes research. A review gate fires. Val approves (or rejects → discarded). On approval, Charm forks into three per-surface drafts in parallel. Kitty collects all four artifacts (research + 3 drafts) into a dated folder under `drafts/`. Val opens the folder, reads, polishes, and ships to whichever surfaces she wants when she wants.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Template registered.** A new entry in `FLOW_TEMPLATES` (id: `content-generation`, category: `automation`) appears in `FlowTemplateGallery`.
2. **Required input.** The template has a required input "Topic" (string) that blocks `pnpm test:app` and the run path if missing, per the existing required-input pattern (#1997).
3. **Familiar selection.** The three nodes that need a familiar (research, draft, drop) use the typed-list pattern from #2012 — no free-text typing of familiar ids.
4. **Approval gate.** A review-and-approve node after `research-synthesize` follows the same shape as `deep-research`'s "Review before sending" node (approval → continue; reject → `discarded` terminal).
5. **Per-surface drafts.** Three parallel draft nodes (`draft-blog`, `draft-thread`, `draft-discord`) all read from the approved research synthesis. Each is independent — if one fails, the others continue.
6. **Output collection.** A final `collect-and-drop` node writes a folder to `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` containing `research.md`, `blog.md`, `thread.md`, and `discord.md`. The slug is derived from the topic (kebab-cased, max 60 chars).
7. **Twitter thread validation.** `thread.md` is structured as numbered posts (`1/`, `2/`, …) and each numbered chunk is validated to be `≤ 280` characters. If validation fails, the node soft-fails and writes a `thread.md.errors` file alongside the partial output (so Val can see what went wrong without losing the rest of the run).
8. **Test coverage.** A new `.test.ts` file validates the template structure (node count, edge wiring, required input schema, soft-fail surface behavior). Wired into the `app` test suite per `scripts/run-tests.mjs` conventions.

## Out of scope (explicit non-goals, separate spec if needed later)

- A "publish blog now" follow-on flow (this template only writes drafts).
- A "regenerate just one surface" mode (would need partial re-run from a prior research artifact — a useful follow-up but not in v1).
- Cross-surface consistency checking (e.g. "does the thread title match the blog title?"). For now, all three are independently drafted from the same research, and Val's hand-polish catches divergences.
- A web-UI editor for the per-surface draft prompts (Charm reads them from `style-guide.md` and from the per-node config; full visual editor can come later).

## Architecture

### Node graph

```
[trigger]
  └─> [topic]                       (required input: string, max 200 chars)
        └─> [research-plan]          (Sage: turn topic into a query plan)
              └─> [research-search]   (Sage: execute the plan, collect sources)
                    └─> [research-synthesize]   (Sage: synthesize into a single summary)
                          └─> [research-review-gate]   ← HUMAN GATE
                                ├─ rejected ──> [discarded] (terminal)
                                └─ approved ─┬─> [draft-blog]      (Charm: long-form Markdown)
                                             ├─> [draft-thread]    (Charm: numbered Twitter thread)
                                             └─> [draft-discord]   (Charm: Discord-formatted post)
                                                   └─> [collect-and-drop]   (Kitty: write all to drafts/)
                                                         └─> [done] (terminal)
```

11 nodes total: 1 trigger, 1 required input, 4 sequential research nodes, 1 review gate, 3 parallel drafts, 1 collector, 1 done. Plus 1 discarded terminal off the gate.

### Node specs

| Node id | Type | Familiar | Inputs | Outputs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trigger` | trigger | — | — | `{}` | Existing primitive. |
| `topic` | required-input | — | — | `{ topic: string }` | Required input. Max 200 chars. Hint text: "What do you want long-form content about?" |
| `research-plan` | familiar | Sage (research role, picked from list) | `{ topic }` | `{ plan: string[] }` | Sage prompted: "Plan 3-5 research queries that cover this topic from different angles." Pattern matches `deep-research`. |
| `research-search` | familiar | Sage (research role) | `{ plan }` | `{ sources: { title, url, excerpt }[] }` | Sage executes the plan. Pattern matches `deep-research`. |
| `research-synthesize` | familiar | Sage (research role) | `{ sources, topic }` | `{ summary: string, headline: string, key_points: string[] }` | Sage synthesizes into a single structured object. Pattern matches `deep-research`. |
| `research-review-gate` | approval | — (human) | `{ summary, headline, key_points }` | `{ approved: boolean }` | Approval gate. Pattern matches `deep-research`'s `Review before sending`. UI shows the synthesis. |
| `draft-blog` | familiar | Charm (voice/copy role, picked from list) | `{ summary, headline, key_points, style_guide }` | `{ markdown: string, title: string }` | Charm: write a long-form blog post in Val's voice for fumadocs. Reads `style-guide.md`. |
| `draft-thread` | familiar | Charm (voice/copy role) | `{ summary, headline, key_points, style_guide }` | `{ thread: { n: number, text: string }[], errors?: string[] }` | Charm: write a numbered Twitter thread (hook → meat → CTA). Each post must be ≤280 chars; node validates and pushes any oversized chunks to `errors`. |
| `draft-discord` | familiar | Charm (voice/copy role) | `{ summary, headline, key_points, style_guide }` | `{ post: string }` | Charm: write a Discord-formatted announcement (no markdown tables; bold for emphasis; <>-wrap links). |
| `collect-and-drop` | familiar | Kitty (general role, picked from list) | All upstream outputs | `{ folder: string, files: string[] }` | Kitty writes `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/{research,blog,thread,discord}.md`. Returns folder path. |
| `done` | terminal | — | — | — | Existing primitive. |
| `discarded` | terminal | — | — | — | Existing primitive. Run state = discarded. |

### Style guide reference

The three draft nodes each take a `style_guide` input that points at `style-guide.md` in the repo root (or wherever Val keeps her voice/tone notes). If the file doesn't exist, the nodes still run but the prompt notes "no style guide provided — use neutral professional tone." This keeps the template usable in fresh repos.

The style guide loading happens once at run start (cached on the run-state object so all three drafts read the same snapshot) — not re-read per node. Prevents mid-run drift if the file is edited during execution.

### Output folder shape

```
drafts/2026-06-28-cross-os-conformance-suite/
├── research.md         # Synthesized research summary + sources + key points
├── blog.md             # Long-form blog post (fumadocs-ready Markdown)
├── thread.md           # Numbered Twitter thread, one chunk per line: "1/ Hook...", "2/ Meat...", …
├── thread.md.errors    # Only present if any thread chunk exceeded 280 chars
└── discord.md          # Discord-formatted announcement
```

Slug rules: lowercase the topic, replace non-alphanumeric with `-`, collapse repeats, trim to 60 chars. If the slug collides with an existing folder, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

### Fan-out + soft-fail semantics

The three draft nodes are siblings, all triggered by the `research-review-gate` "approved" edge. They run in parallel using the existing flow runtime's parallel-edge primitive (the `pr-review` template's `classify` node fan-out is the prior art).

If one draft node fails (model timeout, validation error, etc):
- The failed node's output is replaced by an error stub (`{ error: string, partial?: string }`)
- The `collect-and-drop` node still runs and writes whatever it has
- The failed surface's file is written with the error message as a single `<!-- ERROR: ... -->` HTML comment at the top of the file (so Val can see what went wrong inline)
- The flow's run state is marked `partial-success` (a new state if needed; otherwise `succeeded` with errors in the run log per existing pattern)

This matches the "thread.md.errors" sidecar pattern from acceptance criterion 7: errors don't halt the run, they're annotated alongside the output.

### Required input shape

The `topic` node is a required input per the #1997 pattern. The required-input dialog shows:
- Label: "Topic"
- Hint: "What do you want long-form content about?"
- Constraint: max 200 chars, non-empty after trim
- Default: empty (no auto-fill)

If absent at run time, the existing required-input dialog blocks the run with the same UX as `deep-research`.

### Familiar picker fields

Per #2012, the three familiar-bearing nodes (`research-plan`/`research-search`/`research-synthesize`, `draft-blog`/`draft-thread`/`draft-discord`, `collect-and-drop`) get a typed familiar-role list, not free-text. The roles used:
- `research-*` nodes → role `research` (matches Sage)
- `draft-*` nodes → role `copy` or `voice` (matches Charm; needs verification against the actual role taxonomy)
- `collect-and-drop` → role `general` (matches Kitty)

If the user doesn't have a familiar mapped to a role, the run halts at that node with a "no familiar for role X" message, per existing behavior.

## Testing strategy

A single new test file: `src/lib/flow/flow-templates-content-generation.test.ts`.

It asserts:

1. The template exists in `FLOW_TEMPLATES` by id.
2. The template has the expected node count (11) and the expected node ids.
3. Required inputs match the spec (topic, max 200 chars).
4. The edge graph matches the spec — research is sequential, drafts fan out from the gate, collect-and-drop fans in.
5. The review gate's rejected edge points at `discarded` and the approved edge fans into all three draft nodes.
6. Familiar-role assignments match the spec.
7. The Twitter thread validation logic (a small pure helper) correctly flags chunks over 280 chars.

No new runtime infrastructure is tested; the template structure is the unit, and the flow runtime tests already cover the executor behavior.

Wiring: add the new test file to the `app` array in `scripts/run-tests.mjs`, then run `pnpm check:tests-wired` to verify.

## Performance + cost

Per run, the template fires:
- 3 Sage calls (plan + search + synthesize)
- 3 Charm calls (one per surface, parallel)
- Up to 1 Kitty call (write to disk — could be a pure node with no model call; needs verification)
- 1 human approval pause

Total: 6-7 model calls per run. Comparable to `deep-research` (which also has 3 Sage + 1 delivery + 1 approval = 4-5 calls). The fan-out at the end adds 2 calls vs `deep-research`. Acceptable for a long-form workflow run at human cadence.

If `collect-and-drop` doesn't need an LLM (just file I/O), the cost drops by 1 call per run. Whether the flow runtime supports a non-familiar pure-transform node is Open Question #1 below — answered during implementation plan.

## Migration / rollout

- v1 ships as a new template only. No existing template changes.
- Users discover it via the existing Flow Template Gallery (the empty-state shown on no-flows or the "From template" button).
- No DB migration. No config changes.

## Open questions for review

1. **`collect-and-drop` as a pure node?** Does the existing flow runtime support a node that runs without going through a familiar? If yes, the cost drops by 1 call per run. If no, Kitty handles the write and we accept the call.
2. **Style guide path.** Should `style-guide.md` live at the repo root, in `~/.coven/`, or somewhere else? Val has voice/tone preferences in MEMORY.md and SOUL.md but those are agent-context, not a general voice guide.
3. **Failure annotation.** Do we want `<!-- ERROR -->` HTML comments inline in failed surface files, OR a separate `<surface>.md.errors` sidecar like `thread.md.errors`? Spec currently says both — pick one for v1, drop the other.
4. **Twitter format.** 280 chars per chunk is the X free-tier limit. Premium accounts can post 25k chars. Worth a config option, or hardcode 280 for v1?
5. **Discord format.** Spec says "no markdown tables, bold for emphasis, <>-wrap links" per the agent workspace conventions. Is that right for the announcement format, or do you want a different style?
6. **Parallel-fan-out support.** The spec assumes the flow runtime supports parallel edges out of one node. The `pr-review` template fans out, so I believe yes — but it goes through a `classify` routing node that picks ONE downstream. True parallel-all (`approved` → all three drafts simultaneously) may need a verification pass during plan.

These are the ones worth flagging before implementation. Most can be deferred to the implementation plan, but #6 (parallel fan-out) is structural — if it doesn't exist, the template needs a different shape and the spec needs a revise.
